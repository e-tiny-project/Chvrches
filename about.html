            <p>Mostly deriving from the synth-pop genre, Chvrches also incorporate indietronica, indie pop, and electronic dance into 
            their sound. Two years after their formation, Chvrches in March 2013 released Recover EP, which included hits 
            "The Mother We Share" and "Recover". 
            Their debut studio album, The Bones of What You Believe, was released on 20 September 2013, 
            while the band was ranked fifth on the Sound of 2013 list by the BBC.

            Known for their clean sound, Chvrches' music style is usually tagged as electronic or synthpop. 
            Neon Gold described their sound as "a godless hurricane of kinetic pop energy". 
            Kitty Empire of The Observer wrote they "make accessible electro-pop that's only just short of truly brilliant"
            Wired noted following Every Open Eye's release that the album "cements the group as today's heir apparent to Depeche Mode, New Order, and other titans of British electronic music."
            The band stated that their heroes were David Bowie, Depeche Mode, Iggy Pop, Siouxsie and the Banshees, 
            Tangerine Dream and Nick Cave.
            They are also were influenced by acts such as Madonna, Eurythmics, Throbbing Gristle, Prince,
            Tubeway Army, Robyn, Laurie Anderson, Kate Bush, Cocteau Twins, Death Cab for Cutie, Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark, 
            Deftones, Cyndi Lauper, Whitney Houston and Elliott Smith. 
            The band writes, records, mixes, and masters its songs in a basement studio in Glasgow.
